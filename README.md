# Unity Pet Project (BattlerPet)

Welcome to my **Unity pet project**! In this project, I'm exploring various architectural concepts, composition root patterns, and experimenting with microservice-like architecture within a Unity game. I'm using some key technologies and libraries to help achieve these goals, including **VContainer**, **UniTask**, and **UniRx**.

## Project Overview

This Unity project aims to:

- **Explore Architecture**: I'm investigating different architectural patterns and best practices for organizing code and systems within a Unity game. This includes concepts like separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability.

- **Composition Root**: I'm implementing a composition root pattern to manage the dependencies and initialize various game systems. This helps maintain a clean and organized project structure.

- **Microservice-like Architecture**: I'm experimenting with breaking down certain game functionalities into smaller, independent components that communicate with each other, mimicking a microservice architecture within a Unity context.
